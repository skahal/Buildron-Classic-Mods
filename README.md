![](docs/gifs/BuildronClassicMods-small.gif)

Originally [Buildron](http://github.com/skahal/buildron) didn't support mods. After we created the mod support for it, then we created the mods bellow to move Buildron's classic behaviour, visual and audio to mods.

* BuildMod
* CameraMod
* EasterEggMod
* EnvironmentMod
* SoundMod
* UserMod
